	Virtual IP: 10.0.2.2
1. TCP Scan 
We scan virtual IP on workstation - TCP SYN scan --> There's only 1 host up and 1 IP address, 2 TCP packets 
ARP Ping scan /Parellel DNS resolution/SYN scan 
3 open ports 135/445/3389 send 2000 packet receive 671
Use ARP ping scan 
ARP - 
ICMP - 

2. ACK Scan 
Host is up 
All 1000 scanned ports are in ignored state --> Only RST packets 
1000 unfiltered TCP ports 

3. FIN Scan : Same as above 
1000 closed TCP ports 

4. Null 
1000 closed tcp ports 
all 1000 scanned ports are in ignored states
all flags are 0 

5. Xscan 
Same as aboe 
but we get [FIN, PSH, URG]

6. UDP: Much slower than TCP -- time taken - about 3 minutes
We see ICMP and UDP protocols used in the list of packets 
ARP -- Parallel DNS 
increase send delay (0-50-100-200)
open port 123 -- ntp
open filtered - 67 , 137, 3389, 4500, 5050, 5355 -- ndhcps, netbios-ns, mmcc etc

7.version scan - Gives OS information
syn scan 3 open port 135/445/3389
Launch NES scanning 
135 msrpc windoews microsoft RPC 
445 Microdoft-ds?
3389 ms-wbt-server Microsoft Temrinal Services

8. Fragmentation
we scalled on port 135 because we know its open. 
sent 3 --> Rx - 1 
port state is now - filtered 
Flag is set to 1 -- more fragments : set 

what does --send-eth do? 
135/tcp filtered msrpc


PHYSICAL IP: 129.16.225.86

1. TCP Scan
Do ping scan (ICMP Ping) --> Paralell DNS --> SYN stealth scan
We have an extra open port than before 
139 is the new open port 
sent : 2002 --- rx: 642

One of the DNS has : Don't fragment set 


2. ACK scan 
1000 unfiltered TCP ports
1000 ports are in ignored state  
raw packets sent: 1004 --> RX: 1001 

3. FIN scan [FIN]
Same as above except: 1000 ports are in closed state

4. Null [<none>]
1000 closed tcp ports 
all 1000 scanned ports are in ignored states
all flags are 0 

5. Xscan 
same as above 
but we have [FIN, PSH, URG]
some flags are set to 1 

6. UDP scan 
ports open:123, 5353
open filtered:  67 123, 137, 138, 3389, 4500, 5050, 5355
nmap sends ACK and SYN to fogure out the version 
They also send UDP and ICMP but we couldn't understand the package details 

7. version scan - 
open ports: 
135
139 Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445
3389

8. Fragmentation - 
We send 6 and rx 1 
139 is the only port we check 
it is filtered 
More fragments flag is set as 1 --> IPv4 44 fragmnented IP protocol 

--send-eth : send 6 --> rx: 1 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCANNING TARGET -- Firewall enabled 
NMAP scan: everythign is open
SYN Stealth Scan: everything is closed/ignored 



1. TCP 
ARP ping. paralell DNS, Use SYN scan 
ports that are open:
22 --> ssh 
80 --> http 

2. ACK 
1000 unfiltered and ignored state
not shown - 998 filtered TCP ports 
22 --> unfiltered 
80 --> unfiltered 

3. FIN 
a bit more slower 
doesn't show any particular ports 
1000 scanned ports are in ignored state 
not shown: 1000 open/filtered tcp ports -- no response 

4. Null 
1000 open/filteres 

1000 ignored closed 

5. Xscan 
same as above 
but we have [FIN, PSH, URG]
some flags are set to 1

6. UDP 
Does ARP and then DNS, UDP and ICMP
we did with only port 22 : open filtered 

7. Version Scan 
22 - open ssh 
80 - open http

8. Fragmentation 
-p 22 
sent 516, rx: 6 

--send-eth 
sent 516 , rx: 8 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCANNING TARGET - DISABLED FIREWALL 

1. TCP 
23 open ports 
number of packets sent < rx packets 

2. ACK 
all in ignored and unfiltered state 

3. FIN
Same 23 ports are open but state is open filtered 

4. NULL
same as FIN 
23 open filtered ports 

5. XSCAN
same as before 

6. UDP 
Port 22 closed state -- ssh 

7. Version --> longer time
23 ports are open 
We hae many different protocols - PGSQL, TCP, HTTP, SMB, SSLv3,sip
1 serice is unrecognised despite returning data 

8. fragmentation
23 open ports 
2 hosts are up 
raw packed sent - 2514  ---> rx : 2006 

--send-eth 
same thing 

TCP fingerprinting - used to find configuration attributes of a device, type of OS, type of device the packet originated from etc. 














what is port scan
why is it used 
why 1024 - they're not scattered ports, but they still have many user applications
what is sent on wireshark - we send SIN packets --> before and after TCP handshake 
What do we learn from an xscan - to see if a port is running on a firewall --> and how the firewall is operating 
can we learn from an xscan whether is state or stateless 
When using stateless firewall, we accept all kinds of ack packets becaye we don't knwo if its valid or not. However, state4 knwos the server inside the firewall 
ackscan isn't valid. so state4 firewall will block the ack. 
What kinds of states are there in nmap and - open, close, filtered and unfiltered. 
Open - 
close - rst 
ack
filtered - doesn't correspond to naything
unfiltered - accepts eveyr5hting but doesnt knwo anything about it.

Difference between 5 types of packets 
syn - to see if its open or not --> get synack in return 
ack scan- get ack and if it is filtered, we get rst. if not, we will know 
reset and null - 
null -flag 0 bit 


USE CASES of different - 
syn pack - testing
it its open, easy to exploit, if closed, avoid it
ack - learn about server fireeall rules
fin, null, xpass, - learn about OS of server, send rand combination of packets and 
difference between TCP scan and UDP scan - TCP - if there is packet loss as there is timestamps, If we don;t get ack packet in that time, we can retransmit. In UDP - if we get the last packet, the UDP protocol won't know that is it the last packe, so it keeps waiting for last packer. So if we scan many ports, UDP takes a long time. UDP is connectionless and TCP is connection oriented. 
Why is UDP so very slow - Lonux takes 1 second per scan 

In port list, whats the difference between UDP and TCP scan 
without firewall- more precise, with firewall - we can't distinguished - it shows the closed one also as open. Without firewall, iy can differentiate open and cloased 

UDP vs TCP - UDP scan shows DNS and DHCP etc.
TCP shows - TCP stuff 

How does TCP fingerpringing work - combination of scans - Gives window size of server, how many hopes it has taken, OS of the server 

why do we care about an OS - different OS behave differently. They maintain TCP stack differently, they use different commands, we can keep the commands, shells and kernels 

why do we need fragmented scans - to check malwares that target our server 

difference between - 

some OS don't allow fragmented packets -   - this forces OS to force fragments 

when using OS fingerprinting - can you identify which OS is runnign 

did you scan physical address or virtual --

what are the main takeaways from this lab - 





eth 0 - local host 
eth 1 - st

ss, SA, Su, ss, sf 
-p : port 
-o : for OS -- tcp fingerprinting 

-f : fragmentation 


use 2 types of IP : Virtual and physical 
virtual - found in manual :  
physical ip - ip config in terminal - 129.16.225.86 / 192.168.56.1

disable and enable firewall : given in lab PM 

TCP scan : sudo nmap -ss (TCP syn packet) -v (verbose - to see processing) -p1-1024 *port number*

nmap --help 




Virtual IP:

Physical IP:

scanning target - with firewall 
scanning target - without firewall 

 


if 22 - has only 1 -- sevrer isn;t respodming
